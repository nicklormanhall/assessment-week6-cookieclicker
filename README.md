Week 6 Project: Build a Cookie Clicker in React

User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click the cookie and increment the counter
🐿️ As a user, I want to see the counter automatically increment using an interval timer
🐿️ As a user, I want to purchase items i can afford in the shop and increase the number of cookies every time the interval passes

REQUIREMENTS

🎯 Create state variables to store the current number of cookies and the cookies PerSecond value (useState)
🎯 Set up a timer to increment the number of cookies by the cookiesPerSecond value (useEffect). Be sure to handle clearing the timer using the useEffect return value.
🎯 Set up an array of objects containing the items available for purchase in the store, their cost and their increment increase value. Map through these and create buttons for each.
🎯 Create a function to handle the purchase of an item. This should check if the user has enough cookies to purchase the item, and if so, subtract the cost of the item from the number of cookies and add the increment value to the cookiesPerSecond value.

STRECH GOALS

🏹 Add a delete button to each message, that sends a request to the server to delete the message
🏹 Add a like button to each message, that sends a separate request to the server to increment the likes on the message

PLANNING

One page design to use same image as previous cookie clicker
